	\chapter*{Introduction}
	This project is aimed to design and develop an intent based application. The scenario is the following: \textit{"Consider a set of clients that can communicate through a redundant network
	(e.g., based on a spine-leaf topology.) An external application can request to install paths
	between host pairs, by just specifying the endpoint identifiers, we refer to this as an
	host-2-host intent. The network has to allow communications only among the specified host
	pairs. Moreover, the network has to automatically reconfigure in case of link failures.
	Design and realize a system that allows users to request and withdraw host-to-host intents,
	and configures the underlying network accordingly."}

	
	\noindent The objectives of the projects are:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textit{"Implement a Floodlight module that exposes a RESTful interface allowing clients to create/delete host-to-host instents. The module will then dynamically install and update flow rules in the network to allow the communication among specified pairs. Possible path switches must occur transparently to clients."}
		
		\item \textit{"Test the overall system using Mininet and Floodlight, devising proper scenarios to demonstrate the above functionalities."}
	\end{enumerate}
