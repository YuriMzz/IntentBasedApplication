	\chapter*{Introduction}
	This project is aimed to design and develop an intent based application. The scenario is the following: \textit{"Consider a set of clients that can communicate through a redundant network
	(e.g., based on a spine-leaf topology.) An external application can request to install paths
	between host pairs, by just specifying the endpoint identifiers, we refer to this as an
	host-2-host intent. The network has to allow communications only among the specified host
	pairs. Moreover, the network has to automatically reconfigure in case of link failures.
	Design and realize a system that allows users to request and withdraw host-to-host intents,
	and configures the underlying network accordingly."}

	
	\noindent The objectives of the projects are:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textit{"Implement a Floodlight module that exposes a RESTful interface allowing clients to create/delete host-to-host instents. The module will then dynamically install and update flow rules in the network to allow the communication among specified pairs. Possible path switches must occur transparently to clients."}
		
		\item \textit{"Test the overall system using Mininet and Floodlight, devising proper scenarios to demonstrate the above functionalities."}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\chapter{Implementation}
	\noindent The objective of the intent based application is mainly to expose a REST interface to allow the request of an \textbf{intent}. An \textbf{intent} is a request, done by an host, to have a link with another host, this link must tolerate link failures.
	\noindent Hence the controller must implement a module that is in charge of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computing the best path between hostA and hostB
		\item Installing in the switches of the network the proper rules to establish this path
		\item Being responsive in case of a link failures and establishing a new path to maintain the link alive
	\end{itemize}
	\noindent In the implementation of the application we have re-used some Floodlight modules extending some classes where needed. In the following sections we will analyze the choices done and the classes extended in order to implement the features shown previously.
	
	\section{Floodlight Forwarding}
	\noindent The forwarding in Floodlight is implemented providing the abstract class ForwardingBase\footnote{net.floodlightcontroller.routing.ForwardingBase} which is in charge of providing a base class for implementing a forwarding module. The forwarding module "is responsible for programming flows to a switch in response to a policy decision". The implementation of the abstract class must implement the following abstract method:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
		public abstract Command processPacketInMessage(IOFSwitch sw, OFPacketIn pi, 
		IRoutingDecision decision, FloodlightContext cntx);
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	
	\noindent The Floodlight standard implementation of this abstract class is the class Forwarding\footnote{net.floodlightcontroller.forwarding.Forwarding}.
	
	\section{Floodlight Extended Forwarding Module}\label{forwarding}
\noindent The main module of our package is IntentForwarding. This module is an extension of the floodlight  forwarding module\footnote{net.floodlightcontroller.forwarding.Forwarding} and we will call it also extended forwarding module. In short the added functionalities are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item An array list that remembers the list of active intents (intents database).
	\item The extension of the method \textit{ProcessPacketInMessage} in order to check if the packet that triggered the packetIn is from two host that are allowed to communicate (an intent between the two exists) or not. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Intent Life Cycle}
\noindent An intent is created, is active and then, when the time indicated in the intent establishment request finishes, expires.

\noindent When an intent is created the following operations are done:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is checked if an intent with the same IPs already exists. If yes no other operations are performed.
	
	\item A new timeout task is created and scheduled in order to be executed in the amount of time indicated by the intent timeout
	
	\item The intent is added to the array list
\end{itemize}

\noindent Notice that the creation of the timer is needed in order to implement the intent expiration and to perform some operations when this event takes place.

\noindent The operations that must be done when the intent expires are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Install rules in certain switches in order to deny the communications between the hosts of the expired intent
	\item Delete the intent from the intent database
\end{itemize}

\noindent Thus the main problem is to decide which are the switches where we have to install the rules.


\noindent Let assume that we have two host: \textit{host1} and \textit{host2} and an intent between them exists and it is going to expire. In order to prevent the two hosts to communicate after the expiry and in order to minimize the remaining packets in the network from hosts of an expired intent, the rules are installed in the first switch encountered by the \textit{host1} when sends the message to \textit{host2} (we will call this switch \textit{switch1}) and in the first switch encountered when \textit{host2} sends a message to \textit{host1} (we will call this switch \textit{switch2}). In practice we install the rules in the access switch that allow an host to communicate with the rest of the network.


\noindent The rules installed on each of the two switches are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deny IPv4 from \textit{host1} to \textit{host2}
	\item Deny IPv4 from \textit{host2} to \textit{host1}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Both rules are valid for 5 seconds by default. See figure \ref{img:switch12_example} for a graphical representation.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/example.png}
	\caption{Graphical representation of where the rules for denying the communications between two hosts are installed}
	\label{img:switch12_example}
\end{figure}

\noindent Thanks to this rules no other packets are allowed to pass from \textit{switch1} and \textit{switch2}. It is possible that some packets are in the network because they have passed the access switches before the intent expiry, in that case there are no problems because they are discarded in any case when they arrive in one of the two access switches. Those packets are a few (possibly 0) and so they doesn't affect the performance heavily, the alternative would be installing rules on each switch of the network in order to discard immediately these packets but this would be more costly.

\noindent When the rules are no longer valid for each packet arriving to \textit{switch1} or \textit{switch2} a packetIn is generated and thus the \textit{processPacketInMessage} method will check if that packet is allowed (an intent has been re-established) or not (the old intent has expired and no other intent have been established).

\noindent Notice that due to the fact that the rules installed in the switches are valid for a certain time, no intent can be established until that rules are no longer valid. In the default case the rules are valid for 5 seconds and so a new intent regarding one of the two hosts can be established 5 seconds after the expiry of the old intent. That time can be changed by the network manager through REST.

\noindent The last problems that need a solution is how we can know which is the identifier of \textit{switch1} and \textit{switch2}. When the timeout task (the task that will be performed when the intent expires) is created we pass to the constructor:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A reference to the object IntentForwarding, this is necessary in order to call the function who is in charge to install rules in the switches
	\item A reference to the object representing the intent associated to that timeout task. That object is \textbf{HostPair} and it is composed by:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item IPv4Address host1IP
		\item IOFSwitch sw1
		\item IPv4Address host2IP
		\item IOFSwitch sw2
		\item long timeout
	\end{itemize}
	\noindent That reference is necessary in order to retrieve the identifier of \textit{switch1} and \textit{switch2}. That identifiers are set when the first packetIn coming from the first switch encountered by the packet sent by an host is handled by the extended forwarding module i.e. IntentForwarding (for more on this see \ref{sec:Ipv4}).
\end{itemize}
\noindent Here we can see the code executed when we add an intent.

\begin{lstlisting}
	public boolean addNewIntent(HostPair newPair) {
		System.out.print("AddNewIntent Called\n");
		if(intentsDB.contains(newPair)) {
			log.info(" Intent already present in Intents List");
			return false;
		}
		
		long timeout = newPair.getTimeout();
		Timer timer = new Timer();
		TimerTask task = new TimeoutTask(newPair, this);
		timer.schedule(task, timeout);
		
		intentsDB.add(newPair);
		return true;
	}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{IPv4 Management}\label{sec:Ipv4}
\noindent When a packetIn regarding an IPv4 packet arrives the operations done are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The intents database is searched:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If exists an intent between the sender and the receiver (or viceversa) then
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If the sender is \textit{host1} and \textit{switch1} (in the object HostPair representing the intent) is null then \textit{switch1} is set equal to the identifier of the switch that has sent the packetIn that has triggered this execution of \textit{processPacketInMessage}. Same thing is done for \textit{host2} and \textit{switch2}. 
			\item Then the method of the super class (Forwarding.java) is invoked 
		\end{itemize} 
		\item Otherwise two rules are installed on the switch that sent the packetIn in order to deny the communication between the two hosts for a certain amount of time (as we have seen the default timeout is 5 seconds but that value can be customized through REST API).
	\end{itemize}
	\noindent Here a section of the method \textit{processPacketInMessage}. Notice that when setting the switch id, is the method \textit{setSw(IOFSwitch switch)} that checks if the switch is already set or not and set the switch only if it is not already set.
	\begin{lstlisting}
		HostPair hp = null;
		int hpIndex = intentsDB.indexOf(new HostPair(sourceIP, destinIP));
		if (hpIndex != -1)
		hp = intentsDB.get(hpIndex);
		
		if(hp != null && intentsDB.contains(hp)) {
			System.out.printf("allowing: %s - %s on switch %s \n",
			sourceIP.toString(), destinIP.toString(), sw.getId());	
			if(hp.getHost1IP().equals(sourceIP))
			hp.setSw1(sw);
			if(hp.getHost2IP().equals(sourceIP))
			hp.setSw2(sw);
			return super.processPacketInMessage(sw, pi, decision, cntx);	
		}
		denyRoute(sw, sourceIP, destinIP);
		denyRoute(sw, destinIP,sourceIP);
		return Command.CONTINUE;
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{ARP Management}
\noindent The ARP protocol is used to retrieve the layer 2 address of an host given its IP address. When an ARP packet arrives to a switch a packetIn is sent to the controller and so the processPacketInMessagge is invoked, the method understands that the packet that has triggered the packetIn is an ARP packet and so it must be handled differently.


\noindent The first operation done is checking if an intent between the sender and the receiver exists using their IPs. If an intent exists then the method of the super class is invoked otherwise the ARP packet is blocked.


\noindent The rules to avoid communication between the MACs addresses carried inside the ARP packet are installed only if that packet is an ARP response, in that case the target MAC address is not 00:00:00:00:00:00. In fact installing a rule that deny to forward an ARP messagge from a certain mac X to 00:00:00:00:00:00 means deny X to runs the ARP protocol because for each ARP request the target mac is 00:00:00:00:00:00 i.e. unspecified mac. Viceversa deny an ARP from 00:00:00:00:00:00 to any mac has no sense.	
	
	\section{REST API}
	\noindent To establishing new intent between hosts and in general to manage them we have defined some APIs. All paths of these APIs are defined in the IntentWebRoutable class and all of them use method from IntentForwarding.
	
	\subsection{Add new intent}
	\noindent Thanks to "/addNewIntent/json" API we can insert a new intent to allow communications between two hosts. This API use the AddNewIntent class that gets from a JSON file two IPs (representing source and destination) and a timeout and store it in a new HostPair object. Then use the addNewIntent function of the IntentForwarding class that, first check if new intent is already presents, then in case it isn’t put it in intentDb, that is an ArrayList of HostPair. Moreover, this function also set the timeout time for the pair expiration.
	
	\subsection{Delete an intent}
	\noindent Usingn"/delIntent/json" API we can delete an existing intent. This API use the DelIntent class that takes from a JSON file two IPs and create an HostPair object. Since we need only the Ips representing hosts, HostPair is created without pass the time of the intent (so is set automatically to 0 by HostPair). Then it uses the delIntent function of IntentForwarding, that iterates the intentDB list and removes the intent with IPs passed through JSON. Moreover, this function uses also the denyRoute (explained before) to install routes both in switch1 and switch2 to deny communications between the two hosts.
        
        \subsection{Get intents}
        \noindent "/getIntents/json" API is used to retrieve all intents in a certain moment. It uses the GetIntents class that thanks to the getIntent function of IntentForwarding, it gets a list of HostPair (out intents) and return a list of JSON object representing them.

	\subsection{Manage timeout of deny}
        \noindent "/ManageTimeout/json" API allow us to get or change (according to the fact that we are doing a get or a post request) the time that a rule to deny communication between hosts is valid. This use the ManageTimeout class that use getDenyTimeout and setDenyTimeout functions of IntentForwarding to get or change the timeout time of rules respectively.

	
	\section{Responsiveness To Link Failures \& Topology Changes}
	The responsiveness of the topology is reached thanks to the ITopologyListener inteface. In fact in the Floodligh documentation for the TopologyService it is written: \textit{"All the information about the current topology is stored in an immutable data structure called the topology instance. If there is any change in the topology, a new instance is created and the topology changed notification message is called. If other modules want to listen for changes in topology they can implement the ITopologyListener interface."}\footnote{https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/1343623/TopologyService+Dev}.
	
	\noindent According to this we know that Floodlight handle automatically link failures and also topology changes. To do this it exploits two main techniques:
	
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Every time arrives a packet of which its path is unknown, a new path is computed and is taken up for 5 seconds. If in this time no packets follow this path, this rule is deleted.

	\item Every time that a link failure is happened, a new path is computed.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{UML Class Diagram}
	\noindent In figure \ref{img:class_diagram} we can see the UML class diagram of the main classes of the implemented module. For simplicity only the most relevant methods and attribute are present in the diagram.
